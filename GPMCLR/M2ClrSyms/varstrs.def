INTERFACE DEFINITION MODULE VARSTRS;
(* ------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* The facilities in this library are known to the compiler, and *)
(* are activated by import.  The facilities are:                 *)
(* A generic type constructor called STRING. A STRING OF T is an *)
(* expandable, indexable array of T.  Values may be appended to  *)
(* STRINGs with the representation expanding by amortized        *)
(* doubling as necessary. STRINGs are reference types, and hence *)
(* are aliased by assignment. When a new string is allocated the *)
(* given length is the initial capacity of the string.           *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* Operations on STRINGs are:                                    *)
(* Indexing ... elements may be accessed using [] notation,      *)
(* with a bounds check made against the current length.          *)
(* Append element of elements to a STRING of any type.           *)
(* PROCEDURE APPEND(src : STRING OF AnyType; next : AnyType);    *)
(* PROCEDURE APPEND(src : STRING OF AnyType;                     *)
(*                  nxt : STRING OF AnyType);                    *)
(* Set the new high-tide mark of the STRING at length "len"      *)
(* PROCEDURE CUT(src : STRING OF AnyType; len : INTEGER);        *)
(* And for the special case of STRING OF CHAR we have            *)
(* PROCEDURE CONCAT(src : STRING OF CHAR; rhs : ???);            *)
(* where ??? may be CHAR, ARRAY OF CHAR or STRING OF CHAR.       *)
